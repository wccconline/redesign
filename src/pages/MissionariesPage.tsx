They have had many baptisms and are currently training their new converts to serve in the church and the community.

He preaches and teaches the love of Christ every day and leads them in worship each Sunday. Each day he also serves as a chauffeur for many people with needs. He drives them into Warsaw to buy food, clothes, medicines, doctors appointments, and to obtain travel papers for Europe. He is a dedicated worker in the Lord's kingdom and never stops serving people."
