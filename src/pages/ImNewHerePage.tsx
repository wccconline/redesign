We would be delighted to have you, your family, and your friends visit with us for worship and Bible study at our facilities in Farmers Branch.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Webb Chapel church of Christ is a local congregation of Christian believers who have been baptized by immersion into Christ for the remission of sin, attempting to follow the practices and examples of the followers of Christ of the 1st Century. We believe that Jesus founded only one church, and work to reproduce, in contemporary times, the church established on Pentecost in A.D. 33.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Webb Chapel church of Christ is a group of sinners, clinging to the grace of God offered through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus, upon the cross.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Using the New Testament as our guide, we gather each first day of the week, Sunday, to partake of the Lord's Supper (Communion), sing, pray and teach. In our worship services our singing is "a cappella". This mean we sing without musical instruments. Our teachings are based on the Bible scriptures, as we believe that the Bible is the only source of what God has revealed to us of Himself, His wishes, His expectations, and His salvation.
